# RSP-v1 Payload Definitions and Units

## Purpose

This note complements the main **Robot Serial Protocol v1 (RSP-v1)** specification.
Its purpose is to define the payloads of all protocol messages at the specification level, without discussing implementation.

For each message, this note describes:

- semantic role
- payload fields
- field types
- units
- interpretation rules
- flag meanings
- acknowledgment expectations where relevant

---

## General Payload Rules

### Field Encoding
All multibyte fields are encoded in:

- **little-endian**

### Numeric Representation
RSP-v1 prefers:

- integer fields
- scaled integer physical quantities
- explicit units for every value

### Reserved Fields
Any field marked as reserved must:

- be transmitted as zero in v1
- be ignored by the receiver unless otherwise specified in a future version

### Empty Payloads
Some messages intentionally have no payload. In those cases:

- `LEN = 0`

---

## Service / Protocol-Level Messages

---

## `PING` (`0x01`)

### Role
A transport-level liveness probe.

### Direction
- Host -> Controller

### Payload
This message has no payload.

| Field | Size | Type | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|
| — | 0 | — | No payload |

### Notes
`PING` is intended for diagnostics and reachability verification.
It is conceptually separate from control logic.

---

## `ACK` (`0x02`)

### Role
Acknowledge receipt and acceptance of a prior frame.

### Direction
- Bidirectional

### Payload

| Field | Size | Type | Unit | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `ACKED_SEQ` | 1 | `uint8` | — | Sequence number of acknowledged frame |
| `ACKED_TYPE` | 1 | `uint8` | — | Message type being acknowledged |
| `STATUS` | 1 | `uint8` | enum | Acknowledgment status |
| `DETAIL` | 1 | `uint8` | — | Additional detail or substatus |

### `STATUS` Values

| Value | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| `0x00` | Accepted and completed |
| `0x01` | Accepted, action pending |
| `0x02` | Accepted, already in requested state |
| `0x03` | Rejected |

### Notes
An ACK should refer to exactly one previously transmitted frame.

---

## `ERROR` (`0x03`)

### Role
Report a semantic or operational failure after valid parsing.

### Direction
- Bidirectional

### Payload

| Field | Size | Type | Unit | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `ERROR_CODE` | 1 | `uint8` | enum | Primary error category |
| `RELATED_TYPE` | 1 | `uint8` | — | Message type associated with the error |
| `RELATED_SEQ` | 1 | `uint8` | — | Sequence number associated with the error |
| `DETAIL` | 1 | `uint8` | — | Additional error detail |

### Notes
This message is for meaningful semantic failures, not for arbitrary corrupted bytes that fail framing or CRC checks.

---

## Control Messages

---

## `MOTOR_CMD` (`0x10`)

### Role
Differential drive motor command sent by the host.

### Direction
- Host -> Controller

### Payload

| Field | Size | Type | Unit | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `PWM_LEFT` | 2 | `int16` | PWM units | Requested left motor command |
| `PWM_RIGHT` | 2 | `int16` | PWM units | Requested right motor command |
| `CONTROL_MODE` | 1 | `uint8` | enum | Interpretation mode for the command |
| `RESERVED` | 1 | `uint8` | — | Reserved, must be zero |

### `CONTROL_MODE` Values

| Value | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| `0x00` | Direct PWM |
| `0x01` | Safe direct PWM |
| `0x02` | Reserved for future velocity mode |
| `0x03` | Reserved |

### Semantic Notes
The command expresses motion intent. It does not guarantee that the same values are physically applied. Actual applied output should be reported separately through `MOTOR_STATE`.

### Typical Value Domain
Recommended operational range:

- `-255 .. +255`

---

## `STOP_CMD` (`0x11`)

### Role
Explicit stop request with semantic meaning stronger than a neutral motor command.

### Direction
- Host -> Controller

### Payload

| Field | Size | Type | Unit | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `REASON` | 1 | `uint8` | enum | Reason for the stop request |

### `REASON` Values

| Value | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| `0x00` | User request |
| `0x01` | Host timeout |
| `0x02` | Obstacle detected |
| `0x03` | Safety override |
| `0x04` | Fault recovery |
| `0x05` | Shutdown |

### Semantic Notes
`STOP_CMD` should be interpreted as a supervisory or safety command, not merely as a motor target equal to zero.

---

## `MODE_CMD` (`0x12`)

### Role
Request a low-level mode transition.

### Direction
- Host -> Controller

### Payload

| Field | Size | Type | Unit | Description |

### Role
Request gyroscope bias recalibration and integrated yaw reset.

### Direction
- Host -> Controller

### Payload
This message has no payload.

| Field | Size | Type | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|

## Design Summary

The payload layer of RSP-v1 follows a few key ideas:

- commands express intent
- telemetry reports state
- actual actuation state is separate from requested actuation
- all physical quantities use explicit units
- flags represent orthogonal boolean state compactly
- cumulative encoder counts are preferred to deltas
- payload meaning must remain stable across the protocol version

This note should be read together with the main protocol note:

- **`Robot Serial Protocol v1 (RSP-v1)`**
